# APNGManagement
## About the Program
This program was written because there was little support for the APNG file format,
and my company was experimenting with using it in our game engine. Included in this
project are an APNG data model, APNG builder and 2 APNG viewers (which use 2 rendering
engines, for testing).  

## Installation
APNGLib.sln must be opened in either Visual Studio (2010 and up) or MonoDevelop.  
From there, you can compile and run the various programs.  
The viewers and builder will only work on Microsoft Windows, since they all use the
Winforms library.

## Running the Programs
### APNGBuilder
This program takes a root directory and traverses each subdirectory. For each subdirectory,
it takes all PNG files inside and assembles them into an APNG, followed by compression with
the 7Z compression algorithm. The PNGs are added as frames in alphabetical order.

### APNGViewer
Select a directory, and all PNG/APNG files are rendered. On one side, the standard
(non-animated) PNG is shown, rendered by the WinForms library. On the other are the
animated PNGs. This is to demonstrate that APNGs have a fallback if animation is not
enabled.

### APNGViewer_OpenGL
Works very similar to APNGViewer, but only displays one PNG/APNG at a time, and uses OpenGL
as its rendering engine (hopefully to speed the rendering process).
